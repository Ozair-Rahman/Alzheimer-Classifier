# Alzheimer-Classifier
## Introduction
The goal of this model is to classify brain MRI images into 4 categories,  Non Demented, Very Mild Demented, , Mild Demented and Moderate Demented.
## Dataset
The dataset was found on Kaggle and is linked below:
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tourist55/alzheimers-dataset-4-class-of-images
## Libraries
The following libraries were used to create the model:
<b>Tensorflow</b>
Used to import dataset, perform data augmentation, create model and make predictions
<b>Matplotlib</b>
Used for data visualization
<b>Numpy</b>
Used to help make prediction
<b>OpenCV</b>
used to import images for predictions
## Note
The Images located outside of the directories (Non_Demented_Test, Very_Mild_Demented_Test, Mild_Demented, and Modern_Demented) are there for testing purposes in order to be used as testing data. The images were pulled from the validation section of the dataset.
